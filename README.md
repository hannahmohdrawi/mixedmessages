This code was created as part of a CodeAcademy project from Full Stack Enginner Course. This project was completed Jan 2024.
This is a simple code that creates a random message generator. This includes 3 different arrays to provide tourist information of local destinations and delicacys to try. Using Math.random, I created a function that can be applied to each array to randomly select an item from the array to be incorporated into my final function.
